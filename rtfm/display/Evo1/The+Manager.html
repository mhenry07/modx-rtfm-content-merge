Introduction to the Manager
</h2>

<p>
The Manager area is divided into 3 areas
</p>

<ul>
<li>Top: Main and Admin Menus
</li>

<li>Left: Resource tree
</li>

<li>Right: Main Manager Area
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Additionally there is a floating panel with some action buttons. The type off buttons change according to the mode the manager is in (editing content, managing users and so on). The floating panel is always positioned at the top of the main manager area.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
You can resize the left-hand area by dragging the middle bar (marked green in the screenshot) left or right. &#91;The layout can also be configured differently by the site administrator&#93;
</p>

<h3 id="TheManager-Whatistheresourcetree?">
What is the resource tree?
</h3>

<p>
This is a list of all the resources (e.g. pages, weblinks) in the website, arranged in a hierarchical order. This is where you select the resources you want to edit, move or delete.
</p>

<p>
The number in parentheses on the right of each resource's title is the document ID. There may be occasions when you will need to know a resource's ID. This is where you find it.
</p>

<p>
You can use the <strong>resource tree icons</strong> to perform actions on the tree. Hover your mouse cursor over the buttons for tooltips to explain their purpose.
</p>

</p>

<h3 id="TheManager-Arethereanyshortcuts?">
Are there any shortcuts?
</h3>

<p>
Yes. You can right-click on a resource's name in the resource tree to access the contextual menu. The contextual menu gives you quick access to additional shortcuts. If you prefer left-clicks, you can open the same contextual menu by left-clicking the resource's icon wich is always shown left of the resource's name.
</p>

</p>

<ul>
<li>You can create <strong>resources</strong> and <strong>weblinks</strong> in an existing resource/container (a resource which has children is called "container" within MODx), by right-clicking on the resource/container and selecting one of the "Create ..." items in the list. This saves time moving the item from the first level after you have created it. If the container resource had no children before, it will automatically be changed to a container.
</li>

<li>You can go directly to the Edit page of a document, without having to open the document first.
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="TheManager-Uploadingcontent">
Uploading content
</h2>

<p>
You can upload content (e.g. PDF files and image files) using FTP or the MODx inbuilt <strong>File Manager.</strong> Images can also be uploaded using the Image icon on the document editor toolbar.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
If you are using FTP, you should transfer files to the appropriate folder in the <strong>/assets</strong> folder. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Transfer images to the <strong>/assets/images</strong> folder.
</li>

<li>Transfer pdf and text files to the <strong>/assets/docs</strong> folder.
</li>
</ul>
