<strong>Syntax</strong>
</p>

<pre class="brush: php">
@FILE file_path
</pre>
<p>
Binds the variable to a file, where <strong><em>file_path</em></strong> is the path and name of the file. The return value is a string containing the content of the file. The file path is the absolute path from the root
<br />
of the server or your particular installation.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>@FILE</strong> command is very useful in cases where we might want to generate data that's available in file. By using the <strong>||</strong> and <strong>==</strong> characters as a delimiter we could interface with any external database application.
</p>

<p>
For example: Let's say we have a text file called headline_news.txt that is external to our database system. This file is constantly being updated with up-to-the-minute news items by another external system. We want to display these news items on our website for our visitors to see. How can we do that?
</p>

<p>
First, we might create a new Template Variable and set the display Widget to Ticker.
</p>

<p>
<span class="error">Unable to render embedded object: File (bind_2.gif) not found.</span>
</p>

<p>
We then add the @FILE command inside the default value of the TV. This will point to where the headline_news.txt is located in our example.
</p>

<p>
<span class="error">Unable to render embedded object: File (bind_3.gif) not found.</span>
</p>

<p>
Each headline in the headline_news.txt file is separated by a new-line (lf or \n) character. We can use the Delimiter property of the Ticker to separate each item and display them one at a time. We'll also change the background color of the ticker using the Style property.
</p>

<p>
<span class="error">Unable to render embedded object: File (bind_4.gif) not found.</span>
</p>

<div class="tip">
Note: The \n character is used to represent the new line character
</div>
