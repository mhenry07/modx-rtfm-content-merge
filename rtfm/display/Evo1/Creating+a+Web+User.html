<b>Note:</b> Passwords are not stored in plain text form, so make sure you take note of the password if you do not have it emailed to the new user!
</div>
</li>

<li>You can also set a login home page in the "User Settings" tab and enter the document ID (the document ID can easily be seen in the Document Tree panel to the right) in the field provided.
</li>

<li>Finally, select the user group(s) to which you want the user to be assigned.

In order for the web users to be able to access your secure pages you must provide them with a login screen. To do this you can use the [[WebLogin]] Snippet. See the WebLogin snippet for more information.
