<p>
<b>Syntax</b>
</p>

<pre class="brush: php">
    @EVAL return "The time stamp is now ".time();
    
</pre>
<p>
Using the @EVAL command you can write php codes to do almost anything possible with php scripts today. This is probably the most flexible and powerful of all the commands as it opens up TV bindings to virtually unlimited possibilities.

</h2>

<p>
You can nest one @ binding inside another. For example, an @EVAL binding can be placed inside chunk while you can use the @CHUNK binding to retrieve the chunk containing @EVAL.
