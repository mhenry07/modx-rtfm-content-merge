We all have it happen at one point in time or another... We forgot our manager username/password, and then trying the different options we get blocked!

</h2>

<p>
The secret to regaining access, your database editor, usually PHPMyAdmin granted other editors will work just fine.
</p>

<p>
The first step is to open your database editor and browse to your MODX database.

</h4>

<ol>
<li>Open the <b>modx_manager_users</b> table (You may not have the modx_ prefix, if this is the case just look for the manager_users table)
</li>

<li>Edit the record for your username
</li>

<li>Change the password filed to: <font color="#000000">e10adc3949ba59abbe56e057f20f883e (Your password will be: 123456)</font>
</li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">Save the change</font>
</li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">If you aren't blocked attempt to login with the new password</font>
</li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">Change the password after you login!</font>
<div class="note">
<b>Advanced Tip</b>
<br />
You can set any password by changing the drop down field type to MD5. Just enter the desired password instead of the above hash.
</div>
</li>
</ol>

</h4>

<ol>
<li>Open the <b>modx_user_attributes</b> table(You may not have the modx_ prefix, if this is the case just look for the user_attributes table)
</li>

<li>Edit the record for your user (The admin user is typically id 1)
</li>

<li>Change the blocked column value from 1 to 0
</li>

<li>Save the change
</li>

</h2>

<p>
In some cases you may not have access to a database editor readily available, in those cases it is still possible to restore manager access.&nbsp; You will need to upload your own database editor, such as <a href="http://www.phpmyedit.org/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">phmyedit</a>. You only need basic functionality, so a smaller editor will save you some time.&nbsp; Once uploaded you can copy the database information from the MODX config file (manager/includes/config.inc.php).
</p>

<p>
This can be helpful should the client be abandon by their prior developer, their hosting company not provide access to a database editor, or you are in a pinch and only have FTP access.

<p>
It is possible to add a new manager user without going through the Manager, if possible you should always use the manager.
</p>

<p>
You will need to add two records to different tables, your database may not have the modx_ prefix, if this is the case look for the same table name without the modx_
</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the <b>modx_manager_users</b> table
</li>

<li>Create a new record with the desired username and password (see forgot password for a hash to use)
</li>

<li>If you are able to run SQL commands you may optionally run:
</li>
</ol>

<pre class="brush: php">
    INSERT INTO user_attributes (InternalKey,role) VALUES ('4','1');

    
</pre>
<p>
a

<div class="codeContent panelContent">

Once you have created both records you should be able to login to the manager using the username and password set in step 2.&amp;nbsp; Once logged in make sure to change your password\!
