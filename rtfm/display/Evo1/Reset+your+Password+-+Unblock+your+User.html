We all have it happen at one point in time or another... We forgot our manager username/password, and then trying the different options we get blocked!

</h2>

<p>
The secret to regaining access, your database editor, usually PHPMyAdmin granted other editors will work just fine.
</p>

<p>
The first step is to open your database editor and browse to your MODX database.

<ol>
<li>Open the <b>modx_manager_users</b> table (You may not have the modx_ prefix, if this is the case just look for the manager_users table)
</li>

<li>Edit the record for your username
</li>

<li>Change the password filed to: <font color="#000000">e10adc3949ba59abbe56e057f20f883e (Your password will be: 123456)</font>
</li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">Save the change</font>
</li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">If you aren't blocked attempt to login with the new password</font>
</li>

<font color="#000000">Change the password after you login!</font>

You can set any password by changing the drop down field type to MD5. Just enter the desired password instead of the above hash.

<ol>
<li>Open the <b>modx_user_attributes</b> table(You may not have the modx_ prefix, if this is the case just look for the user_attributes table)
</li>

<li>Edit the record for your user (The admin user is typically id 1)
</li>

<li>Change the blocked column value from 1 to 0
</li>

<li>Save the change
</li>

<li>Attempt to login using your username and password (or newly set password from above)

</ol>

<h2>
<a name="ResetyourPassword-UnblockyourUser-LimitedAccess"></a>Limited Access
</h2>

<p>
In some cases you may not have access to a database editor readily available, in those cases it is still possible to restore manager access.&nbsp; You will need to upload your own database editor, such as <a href="http://www.phpmyedit.org/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">phmyedit</a>. You only need basic functionality, so a smaller editor will save you some time.&nbsp; Once uploaded you can copy the database information from the MODX config file (manager/includes/config.inc.php).
</p>

<p>
This can be helpful should the client be abandon by their prior developer, their hosting company not provide access to a database editor, or you are in a pinch and only have FTP access.

</h2>

<p>
It is possible to add a new manager user without going through the Manager, if possible you should always use the manager.
</p>

<p>
You will need to add two records to different tables, your database may not have the modx_ prefix, if this is the case look for the same table name without the modx_
</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the <b>modx_manager_users</b> table
</li>

<li>Create a new record with the desired username and password (see forgot password for a hash to use)
</li>

<li>If you are able to run SQL commands you may optionally run:
</li>
</ol>

<div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;">
<div class="codeContent panelContent">
<pre class="code-java">
INSERT INTO manager_users (username,password) VALUES ('yourname','e10adc3949ba59abbe56e057f20f883e');
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<ol>
<li>After adding the manager user make note of the ID number for your user, you will need it in a moment.
</li>

<li>Open the <b>modx_user_attributes</b> table
</li>

<li>Create a new record with an InternalKey of your user ID (the number you just forgot from before), and a role of 1
</li>

<li>If you are able to run SQL commands you may optionally run (substitute the 4 with your user id):
</li>
</ol>

<div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;">
<div class="codeContent panelContent">
<pre class="code-java">
INSERT INTO user_attributes (InternalKey,role) VALUES ('4','1');

Once you have created both records you should be able to login to the manager using the username and password set in step 2.&amp;nbsp; Once logged in make sure to change your password\!
