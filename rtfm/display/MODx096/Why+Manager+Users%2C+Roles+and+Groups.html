The primary reason for setting up manager users and groups is to be able to control access to the documents in the Document Tree. Manager users are stored separately from web (front-end) users for security reasons. A web user cannot log into the back-end nor can a Manager user log into the web site (front-end).

Manager Roles are also used to control access to system management functions.

<p>
Each Manager user is assigned a Role that controls what permissions he is granted in areas of system and user administration and document management. A Manager user can only be assigned one Role.
