</p>

<p>
You can re size the left-hand panel by dragging the middle bar left or right. [The layout can also be configured differently by the site administrator]
</p>

<h3 id="TheManager-Whatisthedocumenttree?">
What is the document tree?
</h3>

<p>
This is a list of all the pages in the website, arranged in a hierarchical order. This is where you select the pages you want to edit, move or delete.
</p>

<p>
The number in parentheses on the right of each document's title is the document ID. There may be occasions when you will need to know a document's ID. This is where you find it.
</p>

<p>
You can use the <strong>document tree icons</strong> to perform actions on the tree. Hover your mouse cursor over the buttons for tooltips to explain their purpose.
</p>

<h3 id="TheManager-Arethereanyshortcuts?">
Are there any shortcuts?
</h3>

<p>
Yes. You can right-click on a document's name in the Document Tree to access the Contextual Menu. The Contextual Menu gives you quick access to additional shortcuts.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<ul>
<li>You can create <strong>documents</strong> and <strong>weblinks</strong>in an existing document/container, by right-clicking on the document/container and selecting one of the Create... items in the list. This saves time moving the item from the first level after you have created it. If the container document had no children before, it will automatically be changed to a container.
</li>

<li>You can go directly to the Edit page of a document, without having to open the document first.
</li>
</ul>
