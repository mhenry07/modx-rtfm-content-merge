<a name="Providers-WhatisaTransportProvider%3F"></a>What is a Transport Provider?
</h2>

<p>
Transport Providers in MODx are remote sources that one can download Transport Packages from. Simply by specifying a service URL, you can easily hook into the Transport Provider and grab the latest Transport Packages easily from it.
</p>

<p>
MODx supports an unlimited number of Transport Providers, and each one can be from any source.
</p>

<div class="warning">
MODx recommends not downloading Transport Packages from providers you cannot verify or do not trust. We recommend the modx.com Official Provider at:&nbsp;<a href="http://rest.modx.com/extras/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">http://rest.modx.com/extras/</a>

<p>
To setup a Transport Provider, simply go to the Package Management page, and from there click on the 'Providers' panel heading at the bottom. This will open up a grid of Providers, which you can manage easily.

</p>

<p>
From there, you can click "Add New Provider" to add another, or right-click on any provider to get more options. Providers must be valid JSON files, web-accessible, and in the correct Provider format. Note that the Extras section of modxcms.com is a Provider.
</p>

<p>
The Service URL is the actual, absolute location of the provider file.
</p>

<p>
Once you have a provider, you can connect to it by going up to the Packages grid, clicking "Add New Provider", and then select the "Select a Provider" option. This will bring up a dropdown of Provider options: <span class="image-wrap" style=""><img src="download/attachments/18678072/selprovider.png?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1260560499000" style="border: 0px solid black" /></span>
<br />

<br />
Once you've selected your provider, click Next, and the download tree will be populated with the contents of that Provider's payload (ie, data). This will show you a tree of Package Versions you can download:
