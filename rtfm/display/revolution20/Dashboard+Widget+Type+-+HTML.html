<p>
The HTML Dashboard Widget Type displays straight HTML - nothing else - in a widget. Useful for simple messages and other data.
</p>

<h2>
<a name="DashboardWidgetType-HTML-Usage" id="DashboardWidgetType-HTML-Usage"></a>Usage
</h2>

<p>
Simply place your HTML in the content panel, and it will load the HTML in the widget.
</p>

<p>
This widget type also supports cached placeholders and element calls (uncached calls will not work). So, for example, you can use:
</p>

<pre class="brush: php">
    [[MyDashboardSnippet]]
    
</pre>
<div class="note">
Note that in snippets there is no "active resource", so snippets referencing $modx-&gt;resource will have issues.
</div>

<h2>
<a name="DashboardWidgetType-HTML-SeeAlso" id="DashboardWidgetType-HTML-SeeAlso"></a>See Also
</h2>
