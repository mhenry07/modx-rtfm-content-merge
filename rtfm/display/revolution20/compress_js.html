<b>Name</b>: Use Compressed Javascript Libraries
<br />
<b>Type</b>: Yes/No
<br />
<b>Default</b>: Yes
</p>

<p>
When this is enabled, MODx will use a compressed version of its custom JavaScript libraries. This greatly reduces load and execution time. Disable only if you are modifying core elements.
