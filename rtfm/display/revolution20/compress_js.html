<p>
<strong>Name</strong>: Use Compressed Javascript Libraries
<br />
<strong>Type</strong>: Yes/No
<br />
<strong>Default</strong>: Yes
</p>

<p>
When this is enabled, MODx will use a compressed version of its custom JavaScript libraries. This greatly reduces load and execution time. Disable only if you are modifying core elements.
