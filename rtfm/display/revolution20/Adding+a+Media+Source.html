This article describes how to add a <a href="/display/revolution20/Media+Sources" title="Media Sources">Media Source</a> to your MODX installation.
</p>

<h2 id="AddingaMediaSource-CreatingtheMediaSource">
Creating the Media Source
</h2>

<p>
First find your way to the Media Sources page, often located under "Tools". From here, you will see a grid of your currently available media sources:
</p>

<p>
<img src="/download/attachments/35586535/20110907-8gp9xhgh2dphmhbnwsihtxaeya.jpeg?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1315427096000" />
</p>

<p>
Before we proceed, it is important to note the difference between a "Media Source" and a "Media Source Type" - a source type is a classification of a Source, such as a S3 Source Type, or a Filesystem Source Type. These types point the Source to different media storage systems.
</p>

<p>
For now, go ahead and create a Media Source by clicking on the "Create New Media Source" button above the grid. This should pop up a window with a basic form for the source:
</p>

<p>
<img src="/download/attachments/35586535/20110907-bmtk5qd8b27w8rfhyn4xftw2wj.jpeg?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1315427096000" />
</p>

<p>
Go ahead and choose the Filesystem source type for now, and give it a nice name. For information on creating an S3 Media Source, <a href="/display/revolution20/Media+Source+Type+-+S3" title="Media Source Type - S3">click here</a>. Once that's done, you'll see your Media Source in the grid. Right-click on it, and click "Update Media Source".
</p>

<h2 id="AddingaMediaSource-EditingyournewMediaSource">
Editing your new Media Source
</h2>

<p>
This screen will show your new media source's basic information, a grid with type-specific properties for the source that you can change, and an "Access Permissions" tab that will let you restrict access to the source.
</p>

<p>
For now, go ahead and set the 'basePath' property to "assets/", and then the 'baseUrl' property to "assets/" as well. Save the source.
</p>

<div class="note">
<strong>Right-Click Only</strong>
<br />
All properties are available only after you have created the Media Source and then right-click it to edit it.
</div>

<p>
The other available properties include the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li>basePath
</li>

<li>basePathRelative (yes|no)
</li>

<li>baseUrl
</li>

<li>baseUrlRelative (yes|no)
</li>

<li>allowedFileTypes
</li>

<li>imageExtensions
</li>

<li>thumbnailType
</li>

<li>thumbnailQuality
</li>

<li>skipFiles
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="AddingaMediaSource-UsingYourSource">
Using Your Source
</h2>

<p>
After you've created it, you should be able to see the source in the dropdown in the left-hand tree under the Files tab. If you select that source, you should now only be able to see the contents of the 'assets/' directory in your MODX installation! (If you have not yet created an assets/ directory in your install, do so now.)
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, you can attach this Source to a TV. Read the <a href="/display/revolution20/Assigning+Media+Sources+to+TVs" title="Assigning Media Sources to TVs">Assigning Media Sources to TVs</a> article to learn how.
