<p>
<strong>Name</strong>: Server Offset Time
<br />
<strong>Type</strong>: Number
<br />
<strong>Default</strong>: 0
</p>

<p>
MODX uses this setting to show dates and times (e.g. the Published On, Publish Date, Unpublish Date of a Resource) to Manager users in their Local Time. The intent is to free users from having to consider the server time when reading or setting dates and times. As a System Setting, it applies to all users automatically, but can be overridden per-user with a User Setting.
</p>

<p>
Enter the number of hours time difference between where you or your Manager users are and where the server is. Fractional and negative hours are valid, e.g. 1.5, -0.5. A value of 1 will set Local Time 1 hour ahead of the Server Time.
</p>

<p>
The Reports &gt; System Info page shows you both the Server Time and Local Time, so it's a good way to confirm you've set this correctly.

<strong>Warning</strong>

This setting is handled incorrectly in some places in MODX prior to 2.2.7, notably in the handling of auto publishing and unpublishing.

<strong>For the devs or dev-curious..</strong>
<br />
Server Time here means what time PHP thinks it is, i.e. with the time() function. MODX stores and compares Resource-related dates and times as Unix timestamps, relative to Server Time. The server_offset_time is used to calculate Local Time only in the view.
