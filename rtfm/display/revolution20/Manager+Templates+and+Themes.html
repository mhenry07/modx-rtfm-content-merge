This about customizing the manager and its templates. For example if you want a customized manager login form.
</p>

<p>
The MODX manager uses a template much like regular MODX pages. The manager's template files live inside of <b>manager/templates/default</b> directory. You can update the system setting for the <b>manager_theme</b> to point to the new directory.
</p>

<p>
The way this is set up is just like extending a PHP class: you can override any single file by mimicking the directory structure and updating the <b>manager_theme</b> directory.
</p>

<div class='panelMacro'>
<table class='noteMacro'>
<colgroup>
<col width='24' />
<col />
</colgroup>

<tr>
<td valign='top'>
<img src="/images/icons/emoticons/warning.gif" width="16" height="16" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0" />
</td>
<td>
For 2.1 and earlier, you must copy the entire controllers and templates directory for your theme. 2.2 and later let you copy single files.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>
For example, to customize just the Manager Login template, you could copy the following file into a new directory:
</p>

<p>
<b>manager/templates/default/security/login.tpl</b>
</p>

<p>
Copy that file into a new directory, for example here:
</p>

<p>
<b>manager/templates/custom/security/login.tpl</b>
</p>

<p>
Then update your System Setting for <b>manager_theme</b> to point to the newly created <b>custom</b> directory, and the version of the file from the <b>custom</b> directory will override the version of the file from the default directory.
