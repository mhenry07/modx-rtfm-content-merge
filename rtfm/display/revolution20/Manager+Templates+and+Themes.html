This about customizing the manager and its templates. For example if you want a customized manager login form.
</p>

<p>
The MODX manager uses a template much like regular MODX pages. The manager's template files live inside of <strong>manager/templates/default</strong> directory. You can update the system setting for the <strong>manager_theme</strong> to point to the new directory.
</p>

<p>
The way this is set up is just like extending a PHP class: you can override any single file by mimicking the directory structure and updating the <strong>manager_theme</strong> directory.
</p>

<div class="note">
For 2.1 and earlier, you must copy the entire controllers and templates directory for your theme. 2.2 and later let you copy single files.
</div>

<p>
For example, to customize just the Manager Login template, you could copy the following file into a new directory:
</p>

<p>
<strong>manager/templates/default/security/login.tpl</strong>
</p>

<p>
Copy that file into a new directory, for example here:
</p>

<p>
<strong>manager/templates/custom/security/login.tpl</strong>
</p>

<p>
Then update your System Setting for <strong>manager_theme</strong> to point to the newly created <strong>custom</strong> directory, and the version of the file from the <strong>custom</strong> directory will override the version of the file from the default directory.
</p>

<p>
You'll also have to copy this directory:
</p>

<p>
<strong>manager/controllers/default</strong>
</p>

<p>
to a new directory with the same name as your new custom them directory, like so:
</p>

<p>
<strong>manager/controllers/custom</strong>
</p>

<p>
This is because when you change the manager_theme key value in System Settings it will also reference the new controllers directory. Of course you can probably change the path for that somewhere...
</p>

<p>
YJ, actually, that only applies for 2.1 and earlier. 2.2 will allow you to copy only single files without the need to create the other directory.
</p>

<p>
Good news!
