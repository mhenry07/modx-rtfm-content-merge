What is a Symlink?
</h2>

<p>
Symlinks map a URL to an existing resource. They are similar to <a href="revolution/2.x/making-sites-with-modx/structuring-your-site/resources/weblink" title="Weblink">Weblinks</a> in that they redirect to another <a href="revolution/2.x/making-sites-with-modx/structuring-your-site/resources" title="Resources">Resources</a> or URL; however, symlinks will persist the current URL. The name is taken from Linux, and the purpose is similar.
</p>

<h2>
Use Cases
</h2>

<p>
Many sites may never use Symlinks, but they can solve certain problems.
</p>

<ul>
<li>You can use a Symlink as a kind of 301 redirect.
</li>

<li>You can avoid duplicating content: create the content once, then point to it via a symlink.
</li>

<li>You can apply different permissions to the same content: put the Symlinks into different resource groups.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>
Clarifications
</h2>

<p>
The target page must be published in order for the Symlink to resolve. If the target page is not published, a 503 Error will be generated.
</p>

<p>
Likewise, the target page must exist, otherwise an error page will be generated. Currently, you are not prevented from entering invalid page IDs when creating a Symlink.
