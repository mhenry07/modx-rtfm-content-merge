</h2>

<p>
<strong>Name</strong>: Session Cookie Domain
<br />
<strong>Type</strong>: String
<br />
<strong>Default</strong>: localhost
</p>

<p>
Use this setting to customize the session cookie domain.
</p>

<div class="warning">
You will need to clear your local cookies in your browser after changing this setting.
</div>

<p>
This setting is useful to change if you are running multiple Contexts on one top-level domain, but want to share logins across them. For example, changing the setting to:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
.mydomain.com
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
will allow all MODX sessions to persist across any *.mydomain.com site, allowing logins to work across subdomains.
</p>

<div class="note">
This setting isn't in MODx by default, as it's best to let PHP calculate this on its own. Only set this if you are sure of what you are doing.
