Creating MODX custom manager pages (CMPs) is <b>far</b> simpler in MODX Revolution 2.3 - you simply have to set a Namespace path, and then create PHP files. That's it.
</p>

<h2>
<a name="CustomManagerPagesin2.3-SettingtheNamespacePath" id="CustomManagerPagesin2.3-SettingtheNamespacePath"></a>Setting the Namespace Path
</h2>

<p>
First off, we'll create a Namespace called "mycmp", and set its path to "{core_path}components/mycmp/". Set its Assets Path to "{assets_path}components/mycmp/" as well.
</p>

<h2>
<a name="CustomManagerPagesin2.3-CreatingtheMenu" id="CustomManagerPagesin2.3-CreatingtheMenu"></a>Creating the Menu
</h2>

<p>
Now we'll need a Menu item to link to for our CMP. Go to System -&gt; Top Menu, and create a Menu item under the "Components" menu item that looks like this:
</p>

<p>
<span class="image-wrap" style=""><img src="download/attachments/39354402/mycmp1.png?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1334858685000" style="border: 0px solid black" /></span>
</p>

<p>
As you can see, we're specifying the Namespace as "mycmp", and then the Action as "welcome". This means our default controller will be the "welcome" controller.
</p>

<h2>
<a name="CustomManagerPagesin2.3-CreatingtheControllerFile" id="CustomManagerPagesin2.3-CreatingtheControllerFile"></a>Creating the Controller File
</h2>

<p>
Next, we'll go create the Controller file at {core_path}components/mycmp/controllers/default/welcome.class.php file. Why the "controllers/default/welcome.class.php" path? Well, MODX automatically looks in the "controllers/" directory for your controllers. Secondly, "default" here is the current Manager Theme (so you could make different controllers for different manager themes), so we're creating it in default. And finally, "welcome.class.php" is the name that corresponds to our "welcome" action we put in the menu above. If we had set the Action of the Menu to "home", we would be making a "home.class.php" file instead.
</p>

<p>
Now, on to the file contents:
</p>

<pre class="brush: php">
    &lt;div class="container"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Welcome!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    
</pre>
<p>
A simple h2, with a wrapping div that adds some padding. And that will display this on our CMP:
</p>

<p>
<span class="image-wrap" style=""><img src="download/attachments/39354402/mycmp-final.png?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1334858848000" style="border: 0px solid black" /></span>
</p>

<h2>
<a name="CustomManagerPagesin2.3-We%27reFinished%5C%21"></a>We're Finished!
</h2>

<p>
That's it! That's all you need to start making CMPs in MODX 2.3. You can see that our CMP is now accessible via /url/to/modx/manager/?action=welcome&amp;namespace=mycmp - which is much neater than the ID-based actions of 2.2 and earlier.
</p>

<p>
There's obviously more API methods that you can override in modExtraManagerController in your PHP controller class, and then you can use <a href="display/revolution20/MODExt" title="MODExt">MODExt</a> and such in your actual CMP to make powerful pages, but that's beyond the scope of this tutorial.
