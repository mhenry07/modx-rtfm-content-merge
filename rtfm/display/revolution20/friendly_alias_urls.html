<p>
Turns on friendly URLs, which generate SEO-friendly URL mappings for your Resources. The URL map is determined by the Resource's place in the site tree, and its "alias" field.
</p>

<p>
For example, a Resource with alias 'blog' and a Content Type of "HTML" will be rendered as www.mysite.com/blog.html if it's not a container. If the blog Resource was under another Resource with an alias of 'test', then the blog Resource's URL would be:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
www.mysite.com/test/blog.html
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This allows for completely customizable and automatically built SEO-friendly URLs.
