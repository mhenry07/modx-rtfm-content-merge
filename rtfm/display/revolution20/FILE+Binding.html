What is the @FILE Binding?
</h2>

<p>
The @FILE Binding returns the contents of any specified file.

<h2 id="FILEBinding-Syntax">
Syntax
</h2>

<pre class="brush: php">
@FILE file_path
</pre>
<p>
Binds the variable to a file, where <strong><em>file_path</em></strong> is the path and name of the file. The return value is a string containing the content of the file. The file path is the absolute path from the root of the server or your particular installation.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>@FILE</strong> command is very useful in cases where we might want to generate data that's available in file. By using the <strong>||</strong> and <strong>==</strong> characters as a delimiter we could interface with any external database application.
</p>

<h2 id="FILEBinding-Usage">
Usage
</h2>

<p>
For example: Let's say we have a text file called headline_news.txt that is external to our database system. This file is constantly being updated with up-to-the-minute news items by another external system. We want to display these news items on our website for our visitors to see. How can we do that?
</p>

<p>
First, we might create a new Template Variable. We then add the @FILE command inside the default value of the TV. This will point to where the headline_news.txt is located in our example. Our default value might look like this:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
@FILE assets/news/headline_news.txt
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Let's say each headline in the headline_news.txt file is separated by a new-line (lf or \n) character. We can use the Delimiter render to separate each item and display them one at a time. Our fields will look like this:
</p>

<p>
<img src="download/attachments/18678209/tv-file-input-opt.png?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1330458315000" />
</p>

<p>
<img src="download/attachments/18678209/tv-file-output-opt.png?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1330458328000" />
</p>

<p>
And voila! We have our dynamically rendering @FILE binding.
