<a href="revolution/2.x/developing-in-modx/basic-development/snippets" title="Snippets">Snippets</a> are MODx's answer to inline PHP code. They provide customizable dynamic content, such as menus, blog or news listings, search and other form-based functionality and anything else that your site needs to generate on-demand.

Using a Snippet
</h2>

<p>
Once you have a Snippet installed, you can use it simply by putting its tags in your template, a chunk or TV, or a document's content wherever you want the Snippet's output to be displayed.
</p>

<pre class="brush: php">
[[MySnippet]]
</pre>
<p>
If you expect the snippet code to be dynamic for different users, you can also call a snippet uncached:
</p>

<pre class="brush: php">
[[!MySnippet]]
</pre>
<h2 id="UsingSnippets-SnippetProperties">
Snippet Properties
</h2>

<p>
Snippets can have <a href="revolution/2.x/making-sites-with-modx/customizing-content/properties-and-property-sets" title="Properties and Property Sets">Properties</a>, which can be passed in the Snippet call, like so:
</p>

<pre class="brush: php">
[[!Wayfinder? &amp;startId=`0` &amp;level=`1`]]
</pre>
<p>
You can also aggregate these Properties into a <a href="revolution/2.x/making-sites-with-modx/customizing-content/properties-and-property-sets" title="Properties and Property Sets">Property Set</a>, which is a dynamic collection of properties that can be attached to any Snippet (or Element for that matter). This allows you to share common property configs in a snippet call in one place.
</p>

<p>
Say you had a Property Set called 'Menu' with `startId` set to 0 and `level` set to 1:
</p>

<pre class="brush: php">
[[!Wayfinder@Menu]]
</pre>
<p>
would then load those properties automatically into the Snippet. And even those properties can be overridden:
</p>

<pre class="brush: php">
[[!Wayfinder@Menu? &amp;level=`2`]]
</pre>
<p>
which would override the set's value on `level` of 1, setting it instead to 2.
</p>
