We're putting this here because often a Snippet will use Chunks to format data.

</h2>

<p>
What is <a href="display/ADDON/PHx" title="PHx">PHx</a>? It is a simplified set of parser rules and output modifies that allows you to manipulate data in your view layer (i.e. in your Chunks and Templates). Technically, it's a plugin for MODX Evolution, but MODx Revolution allows for similar output modifiers â€“ this page refers to all such modifiers simply as "PHx".
</p>

<p>
This is probably the single biggest mistake you can do: adding too much logic to your Chunks or templates. The beautiful thing about MODX as a framework is its adherence to sound architecture, and when you put too much logic in your view layer (i.e. in Chunks and Templates), you are destroying all that's good in this world. Sometimes you have to put an output filter or a little if statement into your Chunk, but please, keep it to an absolute minimum. It's a lot like morphine: morphine is a great pain-killer when used responsibly, but it is terribly addictive and it can destroy lives. Yes, that's a crazy analogy, but I have considered opening a "PHx-Rehab Center" for developers with bad coding habits.

</h3>

<p>
Here's an example of a Chunk that got completely out of hand:
</p>

<pre class="brush: php">
    
Dear [[+first_name]], it was nice to see you last [[+day_of_week]]

    
</pre>
<p>
See that? Simple. Short. Sweet.

<h2>
<a name="HowtoWriteaGoodChunk-GoodChunkkeepingChecklist" id="HowtoWriteaGoodChunk-GoodChunkkeepingChecklist"></a>Good Chunk-keeping Checklist
</h2>

<ol>
<li>Give your Chunk a good description so people will know what it contains and which Snippets rely on it.
</li>

<li>Do not include other Chunks in Chunks! Things can get very confusing if you start going down that rabbit-hole.
</li>

<li>Use proper indenting so your HTML is easy to read.
</li>

<li>If you do use some logic in your Chunks, make sure you use it <em>responsibly</em>. <b>Do not nest tags</b>, and do not chain long if-statements together. A good rule-of-thumb is this: if your Output Filter/PHx-Modifier does not fit on one line, then you should do it another way.
</li>
</ol>

<div class="note">
<b>Rule of Thumb</b>
<br />
If your Chunk uses an Output Filter or PHx-Modifier, <b>it should fit on one line</b>. If it is longer than one-line, then you should probably find another way to accomplish what you're doing, e.g. use a Snippet, or create another page to handle the variations.
