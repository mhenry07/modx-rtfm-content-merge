</h2>

<p>
The DIRECTORY binding reads the contents of a directory. This can really useful when you tie it into a List control widget, e.g. if you want to do something like give the user a list of logo images to choose for a page, or choose which mp3 file plays on a particular page. REMEMBER: it returns <b>ALL</b> contents of a directory, including all files and all directories - with the sole exception of directories prefixed with a period.

<p>
When you create a Template Variable, place the following text into the&nbsp;<b>Input Option Values</b> box:
</p>

<pre class="brush: php">
    &lt;img src="[[*myTV]]" alt="" /&gt;
    
</pre>
<h2>
<a name="DIRECTORYBinding-AdditionalInfo" id="DIRECTORYBinding-AdditionalInfo"></a>Additional Info
</h2>

<p>
Can you filter which files are selected? E.g. using *.jpg? The following DOES NOT WORK:
</p>

<div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;">
<div class="codeContent panelContent">
<pre class="code-java">
@DIRECTORY /list/*.jpg  # doesn't work!
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<p>
There are PHP code snippets out there that emulate this functionality. See the following forum thread: <a href="http://modxcms.com/forums/index.php/topic,3124.0.html" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">http://modxcms.com/forums/index.php/topic,3124.0.html</a>

<p>
Depending on how the file is used on the page, it may pose a security risk. Be careful if you were using this binding to select JavaScript files to be executed. What if a user had the ability to upload (and thus execute) a JavaScript file? Also, always be wary of letting users see your directory structure.
