What is the @DIRECTORY Binding?
</h2>

<p>
The DIRECTORY binding reads the contents of a directory. This can really useful when you tie it into a List control widget, e.g. if you want to do something like give the user a list of logo images to choose for a page, or choose which mp3 file plays on a particular page. REMEMBER: it returns <strong>ALL</strong> contents of a directory, including all files and all directories - with the sole exception of directories prefixed with a period.

<h2 id="DIRECTORYBinding-Usage">
Usage
</h2>

<p>
When you create a Template Variable, place the following text into the&nbsp;<strong>Input Option Values</strong> box:
</p>

<pre class="brush: php">
@DIRECTORY /path/to/some_directory
</pre>
<p>
Frequently, this is coupled with an Input Type of "DropDown List Menu" to allow the user to select a file from the list.
</p>

<div class="note">
In MODx Revolution, the path used for the @DIRECTORY binding is relative to the site's root. It is <strong>not</strong> an absolute file path. If you want to list files above your site's root, you must use the ".." syntax, e.g. <strong>@DIRECTORY /../dir_above_root</strong> &nbsp;This binding will work with or without a trailing slash in the directory name.
</div>

<p>
If you are using the @DIRECTORY binding for your template variable &#91;&#91;*myTV&#93;&#93;, you can easily imagine that your template code could have some stuff in it like:
</p>

<pre class="brush: php">
&lt;img src="&#91;&#91;*myTV&#93;&#93;" alt="" /&gt;
</pre>
<h2 id="DIRECTORYBinding-AdditionalInfo">
Additional Info
</h2>

<p>
Can you filter which files are selected? E.g. using *.jpg? The following DOES NOT WORK:
</p>

<pre class="brush: php">
@DIRECTORY /list/*.jpg  # doesn't work!
</pre>
<p>
There are PHP code snippets out there that emulate this functionality. See the following forum thread: <a href="http://modxcms.com/forums/index.php/topic,3124.0.html">http://modxcms.com/forums/index.php/topic,3124.0.html</a>

<h2 id="DIRECTORYBinding-Security">
Security
</h2>

<p>
Depending on how the file is used on the page, it may pose a security risk. Be careful if you were using this binding to select JavaScript files to be executed. What if a user had the ability to upload (and thus execute) a JavaScript file? Also, always be wary of letting users see your directory structure.
