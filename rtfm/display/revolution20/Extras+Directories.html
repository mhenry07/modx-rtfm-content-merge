<p>
Extras are most commonly stored in 2 directories when they are installed:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<b>core/components/</b> - This is the location for all the PHP and non-web-accessible files for the Extra.
</li>

<li>
<b>assets/components/</b> - This is the location for the web-accessible files for the Extra, such as CSS, JS and images.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Why the separation? Well, since MODx users can move the core outside the webroot, separating out the non-accessible files into core/components allows MODx developers to add an extra level of security to their Extras.
