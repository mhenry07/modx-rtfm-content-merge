The tutorials listed here are meant to be short, bite-sized instructions on how to add different elements to a MODX site. If you're new to MODX and wondering how to approach development, these tutorials will be a great guide to show simple use cases that you can use to move yourself from a MODX Beginner to a MODX Intermediate. If you want to know how to do something and it's not covered here, submit a request on the <a href="http://tracker.modx.com/projects/docs/">Documentation tracker</a>.
