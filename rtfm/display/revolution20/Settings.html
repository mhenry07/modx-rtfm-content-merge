<h2>
<a name="Settings-WhatareSettings%3F"></a>What are Settings?
</h2>

<p>
Settings are site-wide variables that can be used by either the MODx Core or by 3rd-Party Components to provide site, context, or user-level customization. The trick here is the override behavior that applies in the hierarchy: <a href="display/revolution20/Contexts" title="Contexts">Contextual Settings</a> (if present), override any of the System Settings. <a href="display/revolution20/Users#Users-UsersUserSettings">User Settings</a> (if present) override any of the Context or System settings obeying the hierarchy of <b>System -&gt; Context -&gt; User</b>
</p>

<p>
See the following for more information:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="display/revolution20/System+Settings" title="System Settings">System Settings</a>
</li>

<li>
<a href="display/revolution20/Contexts" title="Contexts">Context Settings</a>
</li>

<li>
<a href="display/revolution20/Users#Users-UsersUserSettings">User Settings</a>
</li>
</ul>

<a name="Settings-Usage" id="Settings-Usage"></a>Usage
</h2>

<p>
They can be referenced at any point via their Tag, for example, for the 'site_start' Setting:
</p>

<pre class="brush: php">
    
$siteStartId = $modx-&gt;getOption('site_start');

    
</pre>
<p>
Now, all settings are overridable by Context and User, as described above, and getOption respects that. So, if in the above code example, if you had set site_start as a Context Setting that overrode the System Setting, getOption will respect that - but only if you're executing the PHP in that Context that has the Setting.
</p>

<p>
For example, if I were using that code block in a Context called 'boo', and I had added a Context Setting for site_start in the 'boo' Context, and set it to 3, the above code would output '3'.
</p>

<p>
Now if I were in the 'web' context, and site_start was still '1' (from the System Setting), getOption would return 1.
</p>

<h3>
<a name="Settings-DefaultvalueswithgetOption" id="Settings-DefaultvalueswithgetOption"></a>Default values with getOption
</h3>

<p>
getOption supports 3 parameters:
</p>

<p>
1. The key of the setting
<br />
2. An array to search first before looking for the setting
<br />
3. A default value should the setting not be found.
</p>

<p>
So, for example, if I were in a Snippet and wanted some default properties at the top, I could use getOption. <a href="display/revolution20/Snippets" title="Snippets">Snippets</a> automatically pass in an array of all the Properties attached to that snippet (or specified in the Tag call) via the $scriptProperties array. So, you can use that array to check for default properties. This example sets a default value to the 'showPublished' property should it not be specified:
</p>

<div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;">
<div class="codeContent panelContent">
<pre class="code-java">
$showPublished = $modx-&gt;getOption('showPublished',$scriptProperties,<span class="code-keyword">true</span>);
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<p>
Now, assuming the Snippet doesnt have showPublished as a <a href="display/revolution20/Properties+and+Property+Sets" title="Properties and Property Sets">default property</a>, if you called the Snippet via the tag call:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
[[mySnippet]]
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
showPublished will be set to true. If it did have the default Property attached to it that set the value to 0, or the showPublished property was specified as 0 in the tag, then showPublished would be 0.
</p>

<h2>
<a name="Settings-AdditionalInformation" id="Settings-AdditionalInformation"></a>Additional Information
</h2>

<ul>
<li>Only use getOption if you're reading an existing setting from the DB, not if you need to update the option.
</li>

<li>getOption uses the settings cache (it's much faster)
</li>

<li>getOption will also check User -&gt; Context -&gt; System settings (allowing you to override system settings with context and further with user settings)
</li>
</ul>
