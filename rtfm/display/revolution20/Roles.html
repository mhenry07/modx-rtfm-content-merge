What is a Role?
</h2>

<p>
A role is a position or status held within a certain situation. In MODx, it can be used to group Users into a position or status within a User Group, e.g. "Editor" or "Front-end Read Only".
</p>

<p>
Roles in MODx use an integer value called "Authority". <strong>Lower numbers represent a stronger authority.</strong> E.g. a Role with Authority 10 will inherit any and all Group Policies assigned to itself and to any roles defined with Authority 11, but a user Role with Authority 11 does NOT inherit any of the Group Policies from Role 10.
</p>

<p>
Be sure you clarify your language when talking about Authority because this inverse relationship can lead to some confusing sentences.
</p>

<div class="note">
It helps to think of "Authority" as ordinal numbers: first, second, third, etc. <strong>Authority=1</strong> is the first authority and trumps <strong>Authority=2</strong> (i.e. the second authority).
</div>

<p>
You should generally avoid duplicate authority numbers.
</p>

<h2 id="Roles-Usage">
Usage
</h2>

<p>
One common example is to create Roles that mimic a basic employee position structure. Let's say we create the following Roles and Authority levels:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Administrator - 0
</li>

<li>Director - 1
</li>

<li>Coordinator - 2
</li>

<li>Supervisor - 3
</li>

<li>Employee - 9999
</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>
We can then create a User Group called "HR Department". Within that User Group, we'll assign Users to those Roles (you can have multiple Users per Role, as well).
</p>

<p>
Now, let's say John has a Role of Coordinator. Mark has a Role of Supervisor. We're going to give Mark's "HR Deparment" User Group an Access Policy (which is a set of Permissions) called "AccountPolicy" that has the following Access Permissions in it:
</p>

<ul>
<li>view_accounts
</li>

<li>save_accounts
</li>
</ul>

<p>
We've assigned this Policy to the "web" context for our User Group "HR Department". We then set its Minimum Role value to "Supervisor":
</p>

<p>
<img src="download/attachments/18678086/ug-ctx-grid1.png?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1268850154000" />
</p>

<p>
This means that Mark has these Permissions, since he's in the User Group, and has at least the Role of "Supervisor" (which is the Role he has, specifically).
</p>

<p>
But this <strong>also</strong> means that John has these Permissions as well, since he is a "Coordinator" which has a stronger Authority level than "Supervisor". So, John as Coordinator has "inherited" the Permissions than Mark had as Supervisor.
