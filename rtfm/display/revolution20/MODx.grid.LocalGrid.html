</p>

<p>
The MODExt LocalGrid class is similar to the <a href="display/revolution20/MODx.grid.Grid" title="MODx.grid.Grid">MODx.grid.Grid</a> class, however rather than using a connector to populate it with data, it must be loaded through a local store.
</p>

<p>
When instantiating this into a tabbed interface, it's recommended to set preventRender: true in its config to prevent JS rendering issues.
