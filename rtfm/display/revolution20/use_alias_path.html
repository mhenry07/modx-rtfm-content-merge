<p>
<strong>Name</strong>: Use Friendly Alias Path
<br />
<strong>Type</strong>: Yes/No
<br />
<strong>Default</strong>: No
</p>

<p>
Setting this option to 'yes' will display the full path to the document if the document has an alias.
</p>

<p>
For example, if a document with an alias called 'child' is located inside a container document with an alias called 'parent', then the full alias path to the document will be displayed as '/parent/child.html'.
