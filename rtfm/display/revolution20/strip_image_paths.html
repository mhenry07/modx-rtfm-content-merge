<strong>Name</strong>: Rewrite Browser Paths
<br />
<strong>Type</strong>: Yes/No
<br />
<strong>Default</strong>: Yes
</p>

<p>
If this is set to 'No', MODx will write file browser resource src's (images, files, flash, etc.) as absolute URLs. Relative URLs are helpful should you wish to move your MODx install, e.g., from a staging site to a production site. If you have no idea what this means, it's best just to leave it set to 'Yes'.
