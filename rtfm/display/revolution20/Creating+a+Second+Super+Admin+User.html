The Problem
</h2>

<p>
You want another MODx Revolution User to have full manager access, with all the <a href="revolution/2.x/administering-your-site/security/policies/permissions" title="Permissions">Permissions</a> of an Administrator user. Perhaps it's your colleague or your client, but by creating another Administrator, you are handing over the keys to the <em>entire</em> site. This is a simplistic scenario: the other admin would be able to modify or delete your user, so it may not be a viable solution for what you need to do. In the process of walking users through this task, this page gives a brief introduction to roles and access policies.
</p>

<h2 id="CreatingaSecondSuperAdminUser-TheSolution">
The Solution
</h2>

<p>
After logging into your site's manager, do the following:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a new user: Security -&gt; Manage Users -&gt; New User
</li>

<li>Be sure you give the new user a unique username, password, and email.
</li>

<li>Before saving the user, click the tab marked <strong>Access Permissions</strong> and click the button marked <strong>Add User Group to User</strong>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>User Group:</strong> <code>Administrator</code>
</li>

<li>
<strong>Role:</strong> <code>Super User</code>
</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>Save the user. (You can always return to Security -&gt; Manage Users and right-click the user to update the properties).
</li>

<li>Try logging in to the manager using a different browser to verify that the login works.
</li>
</ol>

Why can't I add another Administrator with a different <a href="revolution/2.x/administering-your-site/security/roles" title="Roles">Role</a>, e.g. a "Member"?
</h2>

<p>
Try it. When you try to login using the other username with only a "Member" role, permission will be denied. But why? It has to do with <a href="revolution/2.x/administering-your-site/contexts" title="Contexts">Context Access</a> and <a href="revolution/2.x/administering-your-site/security/policies" title="Policies">Access Policies</a>, which get a lot more complicated in a hurry. If you have a look at Security -&gt; Access Controls and then right-click the Administrator User Group -&gt; Update User Group, then click on the <strong>Context Access</strong> tab. You'll see something like this:

<p>
By default, MODx Revolution has 2 contexts: <strong>web</strong> (the front-end) and <strong>mgr</strong> (the back-end). From this table, we can learn 2 things: that the <em>minimum</em> role is the Super-User role, and the "Access Policy" in use for this context is "Administrator". Even if you don't understand what all of that means, this is a good place to start educating you about permissions.
</p>

<h3 id="CreatingaSecondSuperAdminUser-MinimumRole">
Minimum Role
</h3>

<p>
From the Context Access screen, you can see that you have to be at least a "Super User". Merely being a "Member" won't cut it. So that's why logging in fails for Admins with only "Member" roles.
</p>

<h3 id="CreatingaSecondSuperAdminUser-Roles">
Roles
</h3>

<p>
While we're at it, why would you want to give another user another role if he or she was going to have the <em>exact</em> same privileges as you? Technically speaking, if they have the exact same privileges, then their role is equivalent to yours. In other words, you don't need a new role.
</p>

<p>
When thinking about roles, think about that access policy there. The access policy says what your user can and can't do if you are assigned a particular role.
