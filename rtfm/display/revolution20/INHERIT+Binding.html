<h2>
<a name="INHERITBinding-Whatisthe@INHERITBinding%3F"></a>What is the @INHERIT Binding?
</h2>

<p>
The @INHERIT binding will automatically find the corresponding value of the parent Resource and use that as its value. If the parent Resource also has @INHERIT, it will look at that parent's parent's value, and so forth. If it ends up at the root and no value has been specified, the value will be 0.
</p>

<p>
For example, if you define a Template Variable to use a default value of "@INHERIT", then when you create a child resource under a parent, the value of the TV in the child will reflect the value stored in the parent resource.
</p>

<p>
The devil is in the details here: if the value of a child TV has not been overridden (i.e. the inherited value is preserved), then MODX follows parsimonious storage rules, and <b>no row will be created inside the modx_site_tmplvar_contentvalues table</b>. If you are accessing values via the API, then using the <b>getTVValue()</b> method on a page object, it will traverse up the hierarchy to find the value from the parent resource.
