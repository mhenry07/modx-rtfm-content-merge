<h2>
<a name="CustomizingtheManager-WhatisFormCustomization%3F"></a>What is Form Customization?
</h2>

<p>
Form Customization is a new feature that allows users to create Rules, which govern how manager pages render their forms in the MODX Revolution Manager. It is similar to ManagerManager in MODX Evolution.

</h2>

<p>
Currently, Form Customization has 3 layers:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Profile -&gt; Sets -&gt; Rules
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A Profile is a collection of Sets, and Sets are collections of Rules. Profiles can be restricted to specific User Groups.
</p>

<p>
A Set is a collection of Rules, and is tied to a certain view. Normally, you would have a Set for the Resource/Create page, and a Set for the Resource/Update page. Sets can also be tied to specific <a href="display/revolution20/Templates" title="Templates">Templates</a> (meaning they load only when the Resource is using that Template). They can also have a 'Constraint' set, which limits the Set's execution to the restriction made in the Constraint.
</p>

<p>
A Rule is all the variations applied in a Set. Rules are hidden from view in MODX Revolution, but are instead shown as fields on the Set Editing page.
