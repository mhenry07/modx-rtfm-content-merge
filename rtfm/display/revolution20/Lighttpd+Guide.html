Lighttpd Guide for Setup and Friendly URLs.

<div class="note">
<ul>
<li>This is still a work in progress, and currently only covers the URL rewriting aspect.
</li>

<li>This guide assumes you already have a working lighttpd, mysql, and PHP installation.
</li>

<li>This guide only covers proper settings and the use of friendly URL Rewriting.

Friendly URL Setup
</h3>

<div class="note">
lighttpd does not use the same system, or even same idea as Apache does for URL rewriting. All URL rewriting is done in the lighttpd.conf file
</div>

<ul>
<li>First we need to make sure that the URL rewriting module is enabled.
<ul>
<li>So open your lighttpd.conf config file (In Linux it is usually located in /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf)
</li>

<li>Look for the directive server.modules.
</li>

<li>Under this directive, look for an entry named "mod_rewrite",.
</li>

<li>By default it has a # in front of it. This is a comment symbol. Please remove the # from the line and save the file.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Next we need to find the location in which to put the friendly URL code.
<ul>
<li>So lets search for something that looks like this:

<pre class="brush: php">
   $SERVER["socket"] == ":80" {
  $HTTP["host"] =~ "yourdomainname.com" {
    server.document-root = "/path/to/your/doc/root"
    server.name = "yourservername"
    
</pre>
</li>

<li>Directly under this you should add the following code.

<pre class="brush: php">
url.rewrite-once = ( "^/(assets|manager|core|connectors)(.*)$" =&gt; "/$1/$2",
                         "^/(?!index(?:-ajax)?\.php)(.*)\?(.*)$" =&gt; "/index.php?q=$1&amp;$2",
                         "^/(?!index(?:-ajax)?\.php)(.*)$" =&gt; "/index.php?q=$1"
                   )
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
This does not mean you are done! Lighttpd handles url-rewrites a bit differently. You HAVE to exclude any files or folders you do not want rewritten in the config file. Excluded dirs/files in the example above are (assets|manager|core|connectors). If you wish to add more to these, simple add another | followed by the folder or filename you wish to omit from url rewriting.
</div>

<div class="tip">
After this is done, you will have working friendly URLs again in lighttpd.
