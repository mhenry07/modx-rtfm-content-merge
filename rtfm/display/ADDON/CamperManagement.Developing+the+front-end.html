The front-end of CamperManagement is powered by two snippets: cmCampers and cmCamperDetails.

<a href="display/ADDON/CamperManagement.cmCampers+Snippet" title="CamperManagement.cmCampers Snippet">cmCampers</a> is getResources-inspired and is used to list the different campers in the system.

cmCamperDetails is a snippet that can be used to display additional details on a vehicle, based on a "cid" GET parameter.
