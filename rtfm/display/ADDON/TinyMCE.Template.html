Quick guide for adding templates
</h1>

<p>
Sometimes you have a piece of code that users sometimes need to add and you want the outcome to be the same everytime.
<br />
You can with Templates in TinyMCE.
</p>

<p>
This is just a quick guide for adding templates to TinyMCE in Revolution (I found this in the forums after searching for an hour, so I thought it might be worth putting it here).
</p>

<p>
- In the manager, goto: <strong>System -&gt; System settings</strong>.
</p>

<p>
- Choose '<strong>TinyMCE</strong>' in the 'core' selection box and '<strong>General</strong>' in the 'filter-by-area' selection box.
</p>

<p>
- Look for the property: '<strong>Custom Plugins</strong>' (key: 'tiny.custom_plugins'). Add the value '<strong>template</strong>' at the end of the list that is already there.
</p>

<p>
- Change the value for the property '<strong>Template List</strong>' (key: 'tiny.template_list'). Add the values (templates) in a comma separated list in this format:
</p>

<pre class="brush: php">
name:path-to-the-template:description
</pre>
<p>
Note the semicolon as separators for the three necessary fields for one template. Add more by adding a comma followed by the next list.
</p>

<p>
Apparently you can use a snippet that contains the list, but I couldn't get it to work.
</p>

<p>
- Add the value '<strong>template</strong>' to one of the button lists (select '<strong>Custom buttons</strong>' in the 'Filter-by-area' selection box).
</p>

<p>
Don't forget to upload the template-code in the path you just entered.
