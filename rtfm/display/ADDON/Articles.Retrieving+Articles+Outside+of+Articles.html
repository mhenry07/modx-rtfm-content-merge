<p>
Articles are stored as Resources in MODX, allowing you to easily utilize them in other MODX Extras. The only thing to note is that Articles have "hidemenu" set to 1 (they are hidden from menus) by default - the reason being to prevent them from showing in menus across your site (Imagine a site with 10,000 Articles - that'd be a big menu!).
</p>

<p>
For example, this <a href="display/ADDON/getResources" title="getResources">getResources</a> call grabs the latest 8 Articles for you in your Container with ID 10:
</p>

<pre class="brush: php">
    [[Articles? &amp;container=`10`]]
[[+latest_posts]]

    
</pre>
<p>
...will show the latest Articles posts for that Container. The snippet makes available all the placeholders in the default Template, which are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>[[+latest_posts]] - This shows the "Latest Posts" widget on the right-hand side of the sample template.
</li>

<li>[[+latest_comments]] - This shows the "Latest Comments" widget on the right-hand side of the sample template.
</li>

<li>[[+comments_enabled]] - This will be 1 or 0, depending on if you enabled comments for this container.
</li>

<li>[[+tags]] - This shows a list of the most commonly used tags across your blog.
</li>

<li>[[+archives]] - This shows a list of the latest months (or years) in archive format that you've made posts to.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Also, you can use the &amp;placeholderPrefix property on the Articles snippet to add a prefix to the above placeholders, allowing you to have multiple Articles snippet calls on one page.
