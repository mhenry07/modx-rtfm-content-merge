bdRedirect is a simple snippet that can be used to create a redirect page that tracks clicks for the listing a link was clicked on. You need to set the &amp;redirectResource property on your bdListings snippet calls to make sure it properly generates the redirect_url property.
</p>

<p>
Simply create a resource, and put the uncached bdRedirect snippet call in the content:
</p>

<div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;">
<div class="codeContent panelContent">
<pre class="code-java">
[[!bdRedirect]]
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<p>
It will redirect the user to the "website" url, or to the error page if it can't be found.
