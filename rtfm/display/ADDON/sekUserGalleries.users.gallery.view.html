What is users.gallery.view?
</h2>

<p>
This snippet displays the albums for the selected user's gallery. Each user that has the correct permissions can create a single gallery. The gallery itself holds the albums, there is no limit on the number of albums that can be created. If no gallery is specified in the url when accessing this page, and a user is logged in and has permission to have a gallery, this will default to that user's gallery page.
