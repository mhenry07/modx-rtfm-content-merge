<em>This document is about allowing the User to manage their subscriptions through a web account management page of sorts. If you are looking for instructions on using the Subscribers grid and page in the component, you have not reached the right place.</em>
</p>

<p>
Users will always be able to suspend and/or cancel their subscriptions via their PayPal account, and SubscribeMe handles that perfectly fine through the use if IPN Notifications. However, sometimes you don't want users to go to another site to manage what they can do on yours.
</p>

<p>
SubscribeMe comes with a snippet to list subscriptions (be it manual or PayPal Recurring Payments), and there is functionality available to cancel subscriptions through two FormIt hooks.
