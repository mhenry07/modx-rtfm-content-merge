Setting up the TV
</h2>

<p>
First off, you'll want to setup the TV itself. Go ahead and create a TV,
</p>

<ul>
<li>Load the Create TV page, and give the TV a name
</li>

<li>Select the Input Type of 'galleryitem'
</li>

<li>Select the Output Type of 'galleryitem'
</li>

<li>Assign your TV to your template
</li>

<li>Save!
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Then you should be able to see your custom TV on your Resources with the Templates you assigned the TV to!
</p>

Using the TV
</h2>

<p>
From there, just click 'Choose an Image' and select a Gallery Album from the left tree. Then select the photo you want to use. This will load the photo in full size in the photo editor. You can then resize the photo (and crop it), rotate it, and more.
</p>

<p>
Once you're done editing it, just place the TV's tags in your content. For example, if your TV was named 'photo', you would place this in your content:
</p>

<pre class="brush: php">
&#91;&#91;*photo&#93;&#93;
</pre>
<p>
And Gallery will automatically render the image and place it!
