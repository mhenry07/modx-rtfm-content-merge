TinyMCE for Revolution doesn't feature spellchecking by default.. or does it?
</p>

<p>
There is a plugin available for it, and it seems to partially included in the package (this is version 4.1.2-pl). However, to get it working we need to do a little bit more than simply enabling it.
</p>

Add the plugin files
</h2>

<p>
First thing to do is get the spellchecker plugin from the Moxiecode website. You can <a href="http://www.tinymce.com/download/download.php">find it on this page</a>, download the zip file from the bottom of the page.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
Unzip the file to a local directory and load up your favorite FTP editor. Browse to the folder&nbsp;<ins>/assets/components/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/spellchecker/</ins> and you will see that there are a few files already.. but there's a few missing which are essential to use the spellchecker in MODX.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
I would advice to backup all files (or just delete them - we shouldn't need them anymore after this) and upload the contents of your unzipped spellchecker folder instead.
</p>

<p>
<em>If you're running into permission errors while trying to delete and/or upload files, try to chmod the directory to a looser value (0755 or 777), you can do this through the Manager if needed.</em>

</p>

<p>
Now login on your manager and go to System -&gt; System Settings and find TinyMCE in the namespace dropdown (see image to the right). You will need to modify two settings:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Custom Plugins (key: tiny.custom_plugins)
</li>

<li>Custom Buttons Row X (key: tiny.custom_buttonsx)
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Add "spellchecker" to the comma-seperated custom plugins list to have TinyMCE load up the spell checker during startup.
<br />
Also add "spellchecker" to the custom buttons row of your choice.
</p>

<p>
And now you should be done.

You will need to clear the browser cache in Internet Explorer to see the result. You will probably need a force refresh for other browsers, too.&nbsp;
