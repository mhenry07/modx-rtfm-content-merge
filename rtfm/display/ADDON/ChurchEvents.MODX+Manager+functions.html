Buildings/Location Types
</h3>

<p>
This option is only used if you have the Use Locations System Setting set to Yes.&nbsp; You must have at least one Building.&nbsp; These can be anything like a building, parking lot, park, city or what ever you would like.&nbsp; Just remember that Rooms/Locations are there children.
</p>

<h3 id="ChurchEvents.MODXManagerfunctions-Rooms/Locations">
Rooms/Locations
</h3>

<p>
This option is only used if you have the Use Locations System Setting set to Yes.&nbsp; You must have at least one Location.&nbsp; These can also be whatever you would like but they should make sense as they must fit with in a parent Building/Location Type.&nbsp; When you create or edit a location make sure you click on all the tabs as outlined in red below.&nbsp; You will also see a check for conflicts option that is in red.&nbsp; If this option is set to Yes then any event that is requested or added, must first verify that the event does not conflict with another event for this specific location before it will save.&nbsp; If set to No then events can overlap. <img src="download/attachments/37126295/location-tabs.jpg?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1324584777000" style="border: 1px solid black" />
