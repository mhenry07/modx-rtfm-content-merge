What is Ditto?
</h2>

<p>
This is the documentation home for the MODx Evolution <span class="error">[Snippet]</span> Ditto; a document aggregator for creating blogs, article and news collections, and more, with full support for templating.
</p>

<p>
Ditto lists data from documents to create output in many formats. You can specify which documents, you can specify what data, and you can specify the layout of that data.
</p>

<p>
MODx Evolution comes shipped with Ditto (currently Ditto version 2.1.0) and works straight out of the box; but if needed you can download Ditto from <a href="http://modxcms.com/extras/package/96" title="Download Ditto">the MODx Extras section</a>. When downloading from the Extras section make sure you get the Evolution compatible version, some of the latest releases are for Revolution only.
</p>

<div class="info">
Ditto development for MODx Revolution ceased some time ago and is not expected to continue in the future. &nbsp;<a href="extras/revo/getresources" title="getResources">getResources</a>&nbsp;and <a href="extras/revo/getpage" title="getPage">getPage</a>&nbsp;replaces most of the functionality.

Getting Started With Ditto
</h2>

<p>
I'll try and cover as many of the basics as I can so you can get started with Ditto straight away, here's an example which you can to get a simple blog working very quickly. I have included a couple of the many parameters you can use to build a highly flexible system.
</p>

<p>
Call Ditto as you would with any snippet, for example:
</p>

<pre class="brush: php">
[!Ditto? &amp;parents=`5` &amp;extenders=`summary` &amp;tpl=`tplBlog` &amp;orderBy=`createdon ASC` &amp;display=`6` &amp;truncText=`Continue Reading This Article` &amp;dateFormat=`%e %B %Y`!]
</pre>
<p>
In this example, there's I've called a Chunk named "tplBlog" which will determine how each blog summary is displayed, that looks like this:
</p>

<pre class="brush: php">
&lt;h1&gt;[+pagetitle+]&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[+summary+]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[+link+]&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
