Image styles are collections of properties for the phpThumb image scaler to create nice and clean image URL's, style based. Every single style contains properties which will be passed trough phpThumb to create your image scaling based on the style name and properties. The filenames with Image Styles are made human readable and the link to an image can be much more shorter then without this component.
