</h2>

<p>
Discuss follows the general guidelines of MODX <a href="/display/community/Community+Contributor%27s+Guide" title="Community Contributor's Guide">'A GitHub-based branching strategy for collaborative development'</a>
</p>

<p>
When contributing to Discuss, please keep the following branching strategy in mind:
</p>

<ol>
<li>The main branch to work against is the develop branch.&nbsp;
</li>

<li>The main branch for the MODX forums and its custom theme is theme-modx
</li>

<li>Specific new features or bugfixes should be developed in a feature branch (eg feature-livechat or bug-3532), and merged to develop when done and tested.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
It is important to differentiate between the core of discuss, and themes. All discuss core changes should always be done against the develop branch and never against release, theme, or master branches; this changed on 16th of July 2013.&nbsp;Basically every theme branch should be a fork of the core (release) branch and be updated with that regularly through a merge.
