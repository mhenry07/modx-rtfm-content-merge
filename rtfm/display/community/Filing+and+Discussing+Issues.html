<p>
There is no reason, however, not to use the issue tracker as a discussion forum on the problem at hand. Dialog is often very helpful especially when the solution to a bug is not clear-cut.&nbsp;Ultimately, coders working on bug fixes will use the issue tracker as the first, and possibly only, source of information on the problem. If there is no link to additional information on the bug, that information may never play a role in solving the bug.
