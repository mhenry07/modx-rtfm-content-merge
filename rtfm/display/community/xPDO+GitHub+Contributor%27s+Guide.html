</h2>

<p>
xPDO is an object-oriented framework on which MODX Revolution is built. It is maintained in a separate git repository from revolution and contributing to the xPDO core of MODX requires some additional work.
</p>

<p>
xPDO contributors should follow the same basic process and branching strategy as those for MODX itself. See the <a href="display/community/MODx+GitHub+Contributor%27s+Guide" title="MODx GitHub Contributor's Guide">MODx GitHub Contributor's Guide</a> for details on the branching strategies for features, releases, hotfixes, and more. This guide will focus on the additional steps required to integrate your xPDO changes into MODX for testing before submitting Pull Requests on the xPDO repository.

</h3>

<p>
As with MODX, this means contributors must work directly with their private forks on GitHub. Here is the suggested way to prepare your local repository as a developer for contributing back to the complete xPDO project:
</p>

<pre class="brush: php">
    
[xpdo]$ git checkout -b master origin/master
Switched to a new branch "master"
[xpdo]$ git checkout -b develop origin/develop
Switched to a new branch "develop"

    
</pre>
<p>
To keep your local tracking branches for <tt>develop</tt> and <tt>master</tt> up-to-date from the <tt>upstream</tt> repository:
</p>

<pre class="brush: php">
    
[repos]$ git clone git@github.com:YourGitUsername/xpdo-core.git
[repos]$ cd xpdo-core
[xpdo-core]$ git remote add upstream -f http://github.com/modxcms/xpdo-core.git

    
</pre>

</h3>

<p>
Whenever you have completed a feature or bugfix in the complete xPDO repository, all the unit tests are passing, and you are ready to test the change in another project, you can push the change to an appropriate branch on your fork. Once there, you can choose to manually copy your modified files into place in any external project you are using xPDO with, or use git's subtree merge technique to update the xpdo-core repository with your changes, and then turn around and do the same from xpdo-core into your project's repository.
</p>

<p>
To update the xpdo-core repository, we first need to add and fetch a remote for your fork of the complete xpdo repository:
</p>

<pre class="brush: php">
    
[xpdo-core]$ git fetch upstream
[xpdo-core]$ git checkout develop
Switched to branch "develop"
[xpdo-core]$ git merge --ff-only upstream/develop
[xpdo-core]$ git push origin develop
[xpdo-core]$ git fetch xpdo
[xpdo-core]$ git checkout -b feature-1234 develop
[xpdo-core]$ git merge -s subtree --log xpdo/feature-1234
[xpdo-core]$ git push origin feature-1234

    
</pre>
<p>
At this point, your feature branch is in your xpdo-core fork and ready for merging into MODX Revolution or any other project that has xpdo-core subtree merged into it.
</p>

</h3>

<p>
Now, to test your changes with MODX Revolution, you need to add and fetch your fork of the xpdo-core repository as a remote to your revolution fork. Once you do that, you can create a branch to merge in and test your xpdo-core feature branch. Change directory to your MODX Revolution git fork and get it up-to-date.
</p>

<pre class="brush: php">
    
[revolution]$ git push origin xpdo-feature-1234

    
</pre>

</h3>

<p>
After all of this is done, and you are confident your changes should make it into xPDO, all you need to do is submit your original feature branch, on your fork of the complete xpdo repository, to the appropriate branch of the upstream xpdo repository.
