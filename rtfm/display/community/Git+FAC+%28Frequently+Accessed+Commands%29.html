How do I get and keep my local develop branch in sync?

<p>
First, with MODX's collaboration and branching model, you won't be making commits to your develop branch, so it's easy to keep it up to date.
</p>

<pre class="brush: php">
$ git fetch upstream
$ git checkout develop
Switched to branch "develop"
$ git merge --ff-only upstream/develop
</pre>
<p>
This assumes that the modxcms or <em>blessed</em> repo is set up as a remote named upstream. (git remote manpage:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-remote.html">http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-remote.html</a>)&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
If you've just merged in the upstream repo's develop branch, then it's simple:
</p>

<pre class="brush: php">
$ git checkout develop
Switched to branch "develop"
$ git checkout -b myFeatureBranchName
</pre>

</h3>

<p>
If you are fixing a bug from a ticket in the issue tracker (please file a ticket for the bug first if there isn't one) then you can name your branch "bug-xxxx" where xxxx is the issue number from the bug tracker.
</p>

<pre class="brush: php">
$ git checkout -b bug-1234
</pre>
<p>
If you are working on an "improvement" ticket in the issue tracker, use the prefix "impr-"
</p>

<pre class="brush: php">
$ git checkout -b impr-2345
</pre>
<p>
If you are working on a feature which does not have a ticket, you can name it anything except master, develop, release-, or hotfix-
</p>

<pre class="brush: php">
$ git checkout -b myAwesomeFeature
</pre>
<h3 id="GitFAC(FrequentlyAccessedCommands)-DoIneedanewfeaturebranchforeveryissuethatIworkon?">
Do I need a new feature branch for every issue that I work on?
</h3>

<p>
Yes.
</p>

<pre class="brush: php">
$ echo 'Yes'
</pre>
<h3 id="GitFAC(FrequentlyAccessedCommands)-HowdoIkeepmyfeaturebranchinsyncwiththeupstreamdevelopbranch?">
How do I keep my feature branch in sync with the upstream develop branch?
</h3>

<p>
If you're working on a feature that's taking a while, you may find it beneficial to keep in sync with upstream changes. Git allows you to "replay" your commits over top of changes in the develop branch using the rebase command.
</p>

<p>
In fact, it's generally a good idea to do this before any final commits to your fork and issuing a Pull Request.
</p>

<pre class="brush: php">
$ git fetch upstream
$ git checkout develop
Switched to branch {{develop}}
$ git merge --ff-only upstream/develop
$ git checkout myfeature
Switched to branch "myfeature"
$ git rebase develop
</pre>
<p>
To learn more, here's the git rebase manpage: <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-rebase.html">http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-rebase.html</a>
</p>

<h3 id="GitFAC(FrequentlyAccessedCommands)-DoIreallyneedtoworryaboutthemasterbranch?">
Do I really need to worry about the master branch?
</h3>

<p>
No, not really. If you want to, you can. But it's not critical to the workflow of a contributor at all.
