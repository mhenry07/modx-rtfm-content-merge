<b>Git</b> is the distributed version control system used by MODX for source code collaboration and version control. Like MODX, it's free and open source.

<a href="http://git-scm.com/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Git's official website</a> is an excellent place to get started if you're new to Git or to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">version control and software configuration management</a>&nbsp;in general. You'll want to install Git and get familiar with basic configuration parameters and commands.

<b>GitHub</b> is where MODX Git repositories are hosted. GitHub is a service for "secure source code hosting and collaborative development" but also forms a social network for coders.

<a name="UsingGitandGitHub-Overview%5C%5C"></a>Overview
</h2>

<p>
Here's an overview of the workflow you'll be using to contribute changes to any MODX repository. It will help to understand this first before diving in to more detail.
</p>

<div class="tip">
<b>Fork</b>
<br />
First, you will fork a MODX code repository to your own GitHub account. This is "your fork". You will be publishing your code contributions (commits) to your fork, not directly to the modxcms repository. (This is what makes Git <em>distributed</em>, whereas SVN is centralized around one repository.)
<p>
Then, in order to work with your fork, you will need a local copy, or <tt>clone</tt> of it.
</p>

<p>
Here's <a href="http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">GitHub's tutorial on forking a repo and making a local clone of it</a>.
</p>
</div>

<div class="tip">
<b>Branch and code</b>
<br />
All work on a single issue (bug or feature) is to be done on a <em>feature branch</em>.

<pre class="brush: php">
    git push myRepo bug-1111

    
</pre>
<p>
<em>Note: Making sure your work and your commits are based on "fresh" code will help you avoid problems and help integrators understand, review and integrate (or feed back on) your work.</em>
</p>
</div>

<div class="tip">
<b>Pull Request</b>
<br />
When you're ready to contribute the commit or commits from your branch, you'll issue a <a href="http://help.github.com/pull-requests/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Pull Request</a> from your GitHub account.
<p>
Your Pull Request may be accepted as-is by an integrator or they may make changes or comment, ask questions etc. GitHub facilitates communication with in-line code comments as well as a simple discussion thread on Pull Requests.
