</h2>

<p>
In order to facilitate collaborative development on the MODX source code managed at GitHub, a clear and consistent branching strategy has been adopted. This strategy consists of maintaining two permanent branches in each main Git repository: <tt>master</tt>, which represents code that is assumed to be in a production-ready state, and <tt>develop</tt>, which contains work to be incorporated into the "next release". However, there are a number of important supporting branches that will only live for a limited amount of time, including feature branches, production hotfix branches, and specific release branches. Though they are normal Git branches, they differ significantly in the way they are used in the development process.
</p>

<h3>
<a name="CommunityContributor%27sGuide-Thepermanentbranches"></a>The permanent branches
</h3>

<p>
The <tt>master</tt> branch should be familiar to any Git user, representing the stable, production-ready code in the repository. In our process, we maintain another branch with an infinite lifetime, <tt>develop</tt>. You can think of this as the "integration branch" where all changes are delivered for the next release. This is also where nightly builds will originate.
</p>

<p>
When the code in <tt>develop</tt> reaches a stable point and is ready to be released, all of the changes will be merged back to the <tt>master</tt> branch and tagged with a release number. Each merge commit back to <tt>master</tt> represents a production release, by definition.
</p>

<h3>
<a name="CommunityContributor%27sGuide-Supportingbranches"></a>Supporting branches
</h3>

<p>
There are a number of supporting branches in our process that are used to aid in collaborative development of bugfixes, translation updates, features, preparing releases, and quickly applying patches to production releases. These branches are referred to as:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Feature branches</b> - these are the branches that you will be working with as a community contributor
</li>

<li>Release branches
</li>

<li>Hotfix branches
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Each has a special purpose and strict rules governing origination and merge targets, but are otherwise normal Git branches.

<a name="CommunityContributor%27sGuide-WorkingwithyourGitHubfork"></a>Working with your GitHub fork
</h3>

<p>
MODx contributors must work directly with their private forks on GitHub. Here is the suggested way to prepare your local repository as a developer for contributing back to any MODx project:
</p>

<pre class="brush: php">
    
$ git checkout -b master origin/master
Switched to a new branch "master"
$ git checkout -b develop origin/develop
Switched to a new branch "develop"

    
</pre>
<p>
To keep your local tracking branches for <tt>develop</tt> and <tt>master</tt> up-to-date from the <tt>upstream</tt> repository:
</p>

<pre class="brush: php">
    
$ git checkout -b myfeature develop
Switched to a new branch "myfeature"

    
</pre>
<h4>
<a name="CommunityContributor%27sGuide-Submittingapullrequestforafinishedfeature"></a>Submitting a pull request for a finished feature
</h4>

<p>
Once you have completed development of a feature on a branch, you should first make sure your work is replayed over the latest updates from <tt>develop</tt>:
</p>

<pre class="brush: php">
    
$ git push origin myfeature:myfeature

    
</pre>
<p>
And you are ready to <a href="http://help.github.com/pull-requests/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">submit a pull request</a> for your feature branch.
</p>

<h3>
<a name="CommunityContributor%27sGuide-BugBranches"></a>Bug Branches
</h3>

<p>
If there's a bug in the MODX <a href="http://tracker.modx.com/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Bug Tracker</a> that you would like to fix, here's a simple workflow you can follow.
</p>

<p>
First, fork the MODX Git repo on github, then clone your fork (see above).
</p>

<p>
You may wish to start clean if you already have a release branch locally. E.g. if you already have a "release-2.2" branch, you can delete it locally and start clean:
</p>

<pre class="brush: php">
    
git fetch upstream
git checkout -b release-2.2 upstream/release-2.2

    
</pre>
<p>
Before you begin work on coding your fix, create a branch devoted to your upstream target (where XXXX is the bug number):
</p>

<pre class="brush: php">
    
git commit .
git push origin bug-XXXX

    
</pre>
<p>
Then you're ready to issue your pull request from Github.
</p>

<p>
Log into your Github account, find your MODX fork, then hit the button at the top that says "Pull Request".
</p>

<p>
<span class="image-wrap" style=""><img src="download/attachments/33948128/github_modx_pull_request.jpg?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1370290791000" style="border: 0px solid black" /></span>
</p>

<p>
Make sure you select the "base branch" â€“ you want to issue the pull request to the branch that initially checked out.
