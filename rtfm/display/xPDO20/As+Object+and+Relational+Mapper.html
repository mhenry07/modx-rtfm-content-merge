As a PDO wrapper, xPDO can now easily use its PDO service for interacting with your relational model. Once you define an object model and generate the scaffolding classes and object/relational maps that provide the information xPDO needs, you can use its methods to interact with your objects in a great number of ways. We'll explore these methods in-depth when we get to the section on using your model.
