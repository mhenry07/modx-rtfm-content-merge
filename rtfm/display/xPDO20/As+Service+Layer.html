In addition to PDO, xPDO can wrap other objects you may want to work with alongside your model.
</p>

<p>
For example, you could manually load smarty as an object that you can call directly from your xPDO instance:
</p>

<pre class="brush: php">
if ($className= $xpdo-&gt;loadClass('Smarty','/path/to/smarty/smarty.class.php', false, true)) {
    $xpdo-&gt;smarty= &amp; new $className ($xpdo);
}

$xpdo-&gt;smarty-&gt;someFunc();
</pre>
<p>
But xPDO provides a convenience method for doing this in a single line:
</p>

<pre class="brush: php">
if ($xpdo-&gt;getService('myService', 'myServiceClass', '/path/to/model/root/', array('param1' =&gt; $param1, 'param2' =&gt; $param2)) {
    $xpdo-&gt;myService-&gt;doSomething();
}
</pre>
<p>
If the service instance has already been loaded in the current request, it will not be loaded again, but simply returned. This creates a simple way to provide reusable service objects for common tasks.
