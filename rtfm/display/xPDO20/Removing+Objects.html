<p>
When you 'remove' an Object in xPDO, you delete its row from the database. xPDO abstracts this out into a <a href="/display/xPDO20/remove" title="remove">remove</a> function, seen here:
</p>

<pre class="brush: php">
$box = $xpdo-&gt;getObject('Box',134);

if ($box-&gt;remove() == false) {
   echo 'An error occurred while trying to remove the box!';
}
</pre>
<p>
The remove function will return either true or false, depending on the outcome of the deletion. Errors will also be logged via $xpdo-&gt;log.
</p>

<div class="note">
This will also remove any composite related objects to this object. For example, if our Box had 4 "side" related objects that were mapped out as composites, they would be removed as well when $box-&gt;remove is called.
</div>
