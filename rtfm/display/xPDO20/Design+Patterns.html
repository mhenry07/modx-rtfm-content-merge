There are a number of important design patterns that inspired the development of xPDO. These patterns are well described and are a part of Martin Fowler's <em>Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture (P of EAA)</em>. These include, but are certainly not limited to the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Domain Model
</li>

<li>Active Record
</li>

<li>Data Mapper
</li>

<li>Lazy Load
</li>

<li>Identity Field
</li>

<li>Single Table Inheritance
</li>

<li>Metadata Mapping
</li>

<li>Query Object
</li>
</ul>

<p>
It would be a good idea to at least become familiar with these patterns (and the others in the catalog) before jumping into coding with xPDO; understanding these concepts will help everything else fall into place as you begin learning more about xPDO.
