There are a number of important design patterns that inspired the development of xPDO. These patterns are well described and are a part of Martin Fowler's <em>Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture (P of EAA)</em>. These include, but are certainly not limited to the Domain Model, Active Record, Data Mapper, Lazy Load, Identity Field, Single Table Inheritance, Metadata Mapping, and Query Object. It would be a good idea to at least become familiar with these patterns (and the others in the catalog) before jumping into coding with xPDO; understanding these concepts will help everything else fall into place as you begin learning more about xPDO.
