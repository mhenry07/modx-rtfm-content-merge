<p>
Let's say we have a Package called 'Storefinder'. We want to create a custom schema for that package. First off, we'll create a schema file with this name:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
storefinder.mysql.schema.xml
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If you note, we added in the 'mysql' postfix to the filename, since xPDO will eventually allow for multiple database development. We want to specify that this schema is for a MySQL table.
</p>

<h2>
<a name="DefiningtheDatabaseandTables-StartingwithaDatabase" id="DefiningtheDatabaseandTables-StartingwithaDatabase"></a>Starting with a Database
</h2>

<p>
Our current XML file looks like this:
</p>

<pre class="brush: xml">
    &lt;object class="sfStore" table="sfinder_stores" extends="xPDOSimpleObject"&gt;

    
</pre>
<p>
"Object" is our representation of a table, which will generate into an xPDOObject class when we're through. There are some attributes to note here:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<b>class</b> - This is the name of the class we want to be generated from the table. Here, we'll use "sfStore". Note that instead of just "Store", we prefixed it with "sf" to prevent collisions with any other packages we might install that might also have Store tables.
</li>

<li>
<b>table</b> - This should point to the actual database table name, minus the prefix.
</li>

<li>
<b>extends</b> - This is the class that it extends. Note that you can make subclasses and extended classes straight from the XML. Extended classes will inherit their parent class's fields.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
You'll see here that this table extends "xPDOSimpleObject", rather than xPDOObject. This means that the table comes already with an "id" field, that is an auto-increment primary key.
</p>

<p>
Now that we've got a table definition for our stores table, let's add some field definitions to it:
</p>

<pre class="brush: xml">
    &lt;/object&gt;

    
</pre>
<p>
Now let's add an "sfOwner" class, which will represent any owners we have:
</p>

<pre class="brush: xml">
    &lt;object class="sfStoreOwner" table="sfinder_store_owners" extends="xPDOSimpleObject"&gt;
  &lt;field key="store" dbtype="int" precision="10" attributes="unsigned" phptype="integer" null="false" default="0" index="index" /&gt;
  &lt;field key="owner" dbtype="int" precision="10" attributes="unsigned" phptype="integer" null="false" default="0" index="index" /&gt;
&lt;/object&gt;

    
</pre>
<p>
Let's close the model definition:
</p>

<div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;">
<div class="codeContent panelContent">
<pre class="code-xml">
<span class="code-tag">&lt;/model&gt;</span>
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<p>
We have a completed XML schema for our model. Now we'll need to <a href="display/XPDO10/Defining+Relationships" title="Defining Relationships">define relationships for that schema</a>.
</p>
