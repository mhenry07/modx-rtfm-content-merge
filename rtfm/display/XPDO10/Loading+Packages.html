Packages are loaded in xPDO via the addPackage method. This method takes 3 parameters: 'name', 'path' and 'table_prefix'. Name is the name of the model package, whereas path is an absolute path to that model directory. The table_prefix states what the table prefix for the tables of the classes will be. If it's not set, it will default to the xPDO connection default. Let's say we have a xPDO model package already built (with all the maps and classes) in:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
/myapp/core/model/boxpackage/
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And our table prefix is 'myapp_'. So, we'll pass the first parameter as the package name - in this case 'boxpackage' - and the model path as the 2nd parameter:
</p>

<pre class="brush: php">
$xpdo-&gt;addPackage('boxpackage','/myapp/core/model/','myapp_');
</pre>
<p>
From then on out, any of our classes in our Package can be loaded via xPDO's retrieval methods.
